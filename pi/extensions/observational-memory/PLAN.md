## Locked decisions (resolved with user)

| # | Topic | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Build order** | **Phased: A (short-term tier + TUI) → B (long-term tier).** TUI is built from the start (it is the observability surface for the extension itself), not deferred. |
| L2 | **Worker spawning** | **Bespoke `child_process.spawn` of `pi -e <agent-ext> -p`** (the yt-edit launcher pattern). *Not* the `subagents` extension — that uses `--no-session --mode json`, which would defeat decision 11's "every worker is an ordinary recorded global session" observability requirement. |
| L3 | **OM code reuse** | **Vendor/fork** the needed OM modules into this repo (`session-ledger` fold/progress/projection/render, `tokens`, `ids`, `serialize`, `debug-log`), **trimmed to the minimal `{timestamp, content}` schema** and with the reflections tier removed. No runtime dependency on the unstable OM `master` checkout. |
| L4 | **Extension structure** | **One shared agent extension, env-parameterized by worker type** (`OM_WORKER=observer\|consolidator`), mirroring yt-edit's `FINALIZE_MODE` switch. Plus a separate **master-side orchestrator** extension. |
| L5 | **Timestamp-id** | **Orchestrator-assigned**, anchored to the chunk's source-entry times, with a deterministic disambiguator suffix. The observer emits minute-resolution event times (OM-proven); the orchestrator derives the precise unique id at commit. Avoids the LLM copy-fidelity risk (design risk 7). |
| L6 | **Dev default models** | **Strong model everywhere** for bring-up: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `thinking: low` for observers, `thinking: medium` for the consolidator. Fully overridable in config; tune the cheap-observer split later. |
| L7 | **Per-session on/off gate** | A simple **default-OFF** master switch (`/om`, `/om on/off`), persisted per-session in the ledger. When off the extension is completely inert/invisible. Needed because it ships in the global extensions folder during development. See A2a. |

### Phasing consequence to keep in mind (stated explicitly)

Phase A ships **without** the consolidator. Nothing drains the observation buffer, so it is
**not yet bounded** — it grows like OM pre-dropper until compaction renders it. This is an
acceptable, fully-testable intermediate state (observer → ledger → injection → compaction →
`/tree` all exercised). Bounding (`poolTargetTokens`) and the file tier arrive in Phase B
with the consolidator. The compaction renderer in Phase A renders *all* active observations
up to the cutoff; the same renderer in Phase B renders the *bounded* buffer because the
consolidator has tombstoned the overflow.

WORKER SESSIONS  (subprocess `pi`, headless, recorded in global store)
└─ agent extension (OM_WORKER=observer|consolidator)
     • before_agent_start     → replace system prompt for the worker role
     • --no-builtin-tools     → register only the tools the role needs

     • consolidator: read/write/edit scoped to .memory/ (no terminal tool; natural exit) [Phase B]
```

The two extensions live in this repo and are wired by the orchestrator at spawn time with
the verified flag set (below).

from it is needed.)

## Data shapes

### Observation (minimal, L5)

```ts
type Observation = {
  timestamp: string;   // "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.NN]" — orchestrator-assigned id+time
  content: string;     // single-line plain prose
  tokenCount: number;  // computed in code, not by the model
};
```

The observer model emits `{ timestamp: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM", content }` (minute resolution,
OM-proven). The orchestrator, at commit, **re-derives** a precise, unique id-timestamp:
- anchor to the source entry the observation cites (or the chunk's time span midpoint if no
  cite in v1's no-`sourceEntryIds` world → use the chunk's bounding source-entry timestamps),
- ensure strict uniqueness across the committed batch by appending `.01`, `.02`, … when two
  observations resolve to the same second.

> v1 has no `sourceEntryIds` in the stored unit (decision 9). To anchor timestamps the
> orchestrator uses the **chunk boundary source-entry times** it already knows (it built the
> chunk), distributing observations across that span in model-emitted order. Exact per-obs
> source attribution returns with the critic/drill-to-source tier (post-v1).

### Ledger entries (vendored, trimmed)

```ts
// om.observations.recorded
data: { observations: Observation[]; coversUpToId: string }

// om.observations.dropped   (Phase B — consolidator promotion tombstones)
data: { observationTimestamps: string[]; coversUpToId: string }
```

`coversUpToId` semantics are unchanged from OM: a progress + projection watermark equal to
the id of the last source entry the worker covered. Folding to a `/tree` position replays
entries whose `coversUpToId` resolves at-or-before that position — this is what makes
short-term memory roll back natively (design requirement).

### Compaction details

```ts
details: { type: "om.folded"; version: 1; observations: Observation[] }
```

Rendered by `session_before_compact`; read back by any future visible projection.

---

## Phase A — short-term tier + TUI

Goal: a working observer → ledger → injection → compaction loop that is correct under
`/tree`, with full TUI/observability. No `.memory/` files yet.

### A1. Scaffolding
- `package.json`, `tsconfig`, `vitest`. Copy the dependency set from OM's `package.json`.
- Vendor + trim from OM: `tokens.ts`, `ids.ts` (then extend for L5), `serialize.ts`,
  `debug-log.ts`, and `ledger/{types,fold,progress,projection,render}.ts`. Strip reflections,
  `relevance`, `sourceEntryIds`, hash-ids, dropper-specific pool logic. Keep watermark folding,
  source-entry detection, raw-token clocks, compaction projection, deterministic render.
- Port OM's vitest suites for the kept modules; delete reflection/relevance assertions.

### A2. Orchestrator skeleton (`src/index.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `config.ts`)
- `session_start`: read the persisted on/off gate (A2a); `ensureConfig(ctx.cwd)`; if **on**,
  attach TUI status (`setStatus("om", "om")`); if **off**, stay fully invisible.
- `session_shutdown`: detach status, abort in-flight workers.
- In-process `Runtime`: `enabled: boolean`, `observersInFlight: Map<runId, AbortController>`,
  clocks, last-error, status controller. Event-driven only — **no daemon/timer** (per design +
  extension rules).

### A2a. Per-session on/off gate (default OFF) — simple, like `memory.ts`
- **Why:** the extension lives in the global `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` folder during
  development, so it would otherwise attach to *every* pi session. The gate keeps it inert
  unless explicitly enabled in a session.
- **State:** persisted per-session via `pi.appendEntry("om.enabled", { enabled })`. On
  `session_start`, scan the branch backwards for the latest `om.enabled` entry; default
  `false` if none. Survives restarts/resume within that session lineage.
- **Command:** `/om` toggles; `/om on` / `/om off` set explicitly. On change: append the state
  entry, attach/detach TUI, `ctx.ui.notify("om enabled/disabled")`.
- **Gate semantics:** when `enabled === false` the extension is **completely invisible and
  does nothing** — every trigger (`turn_end` observer clock, `agent_end` compaction trigger),
  the `session_before_compact` hook, all TUI, and all worker spawning return immediately at the
  top. No footer, no widgets, no ledger writes, no subprocesses. A single `if (!runtime.enabled) return;`
  is the first line of every handler (mirrors OM's `passive` short-circuit, but here it is the
  master switch and defaults off).
- Distinct from config `passive`: `passive` is a power-user setting; the gate is the
  build-time master switch and is the outermost guard.

### A3. Parallel observers (`hooks/observer-trigger.ts`, `spawn/`)
- Trigger on `turn_end` (and `agent_start` for catch-up, mirroring OM).
- Clock: `rawTokensSinceObservationCoverage(branch) >= chunkTokens` (5000 default).
  Unlike OM (which couples observers sequentially), **cut at fixed token boundaries** and
  **fire observers in parallel** — each is a pure mapper over its own chunk. The watermark
  advances per committed chunk; multiple chunks can be in flight at once.
- For each due chunk:
  1. Select the source-entry slice after the latest covered watermark, bounded to ~`chunkTokens`.
     `coversUpToId` = last source entry id in the slice.
  2. `serializeSourceAddressedBranchEntries(slice)` → serialized chunk; wrap with a short
     framing line (current local time + instruction) to form the stdin prompt (no prior
     observations needed).
  3. Spawn observer subprocess (A4), passing that prompt through stdin with `-p`. TUI: widget `◐ [observer]`
     keyed by `<runId>`, start toast.
  4. On exit: read `.memory/.runs/<runId>.result.json`; validate; **commit on the master ledger**:
     - assign disambiguated timestamp-ids (L5),
     - `pi.appendEntry("om.observations.recorded", { observations, coversUpToId })`.
     - TUI: `✓ [observer] +N`, finish toast. On failure: `✗`, error toast, record last-error.
- Concurrency: observers are independent; cap via a small semaphore (default 4) to bound spawn
  load. Out-of-order completion is fine — each commit carries its own `coversUpToId`.

> **Chunk overlap:** default **0** in v1 (simplest). Boundary-spanning events are tolerated;
> the consolidator dedupes in Phase B. `chunkOverlapTokens` is a config knob, defaulting 0.

### A4. Subprocess launch (`spawn/launch.ts`) — the yt-edit pattern (L2)
```
pi --no-extensions --no-skills --no-prompt-templates --no-context-files \
   --no-builtin-tools \
   --model <m> --thinking <t> \
   -e <repo>/agent/index.ts \
   -n om-observer-<runId> \
   -p                         # full prompt is written to stdin
```
- `-p` is the print/headless flag. The full prompt (a short framing line plus the serialized
  chunk) is written to the worker's stdin after spawn. Pi's print mode treats piped stdin as the
  initial user message, so the chunk remains a recorded user message in the worker's global
  session and stays faithfully inspectable on resume (decision 11's observability requirement).
- **Why stdin instead of argv:** Windows has a roughly 32 KB process-command-line limit, and
  `ENAMETOOLONG` is raised when a normal observer chunk is placed in `-p`. POSIX systems have
  larger but still finite argv limits. Stdin is a streaming, cross-platform transport with no
  practical command-line-size dependency.
- **Why not the `context` hook / system prompt:** the `context` hook is non-destructive — its
  injected messages are used for the LLM call but **never persisted** to the session, so the
  chunk would be invisible when inspecting/resuming the observer run (verified). Putting the
  chunk in the system prompt has the same recall value but is the wrong semantic slot. Stdin
  preserves the user-message boundary without the argv limit.
- env: `OM_WORKER=observer`, `OM_RUN_ID=<runId>`, `OM_RESULT_PATH=<abs .memory/.runs/<id>.result.json>`.
  The chunk is streamed through stdin, not passed via env, argv, or `OM_CHUNK_PATH`.
- `cwd` = the master's `.memory/<sessionId>/` root (so the worker session is recorded in a
  distinct project-keyed bucket in the **global** store `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, satisfying
  decision 11 — no `--session-dir`).
- Resolve the `pi` binary via `process.argv[1]` realpath (subagents' `resolvePiBinary` trick),
  falling back to `pi` on PATH.
- Completion: the worker's terminal tool writes the result file then calls `ctx.shutdown()`;
  the parent `await`s process exit, then reads + validates the result file. Non-zero exit or
  missing/invalid file → error path.

### A5. Worker agent extension (`agent/index.ts`, `agent/observer/`) (L4)
- Default export branches on `process.env.OM_WORKER`.
- `before_agent_start`: **replace** the system prompt entirely with the observer
  instructions (return `{ systemPrompt: OBSERVER_SYSTEM }`). The system prompt contains
  role definition and quality rules only — **no chunk content**. Builtins already
  disabled by `--no-builtin-tools`.
- **Chunk delivery is the recorded stdin prompt** (built by the orchestrator, see A3/A4) —
  pi reads piped stdin in print mode and records it as the first user message. The agent
  deliberately does **not** use the `context` hook (non-destructive → not persisted → invisible
  on resume). System prompt/user-message boundary stays correct: system prompt = persistent
  instructions; user message = this run's input, and it survives in the session record.
- Register `record_observations` (typebox schema: `{ observations: [{ timestamp, content }] }`,
  minute-resolution timestamp pattern). On call: accumulate; on the terminal call (model stops),
  write `OM_RUNS_DIR/OM_RUN_ID.json` = `{ observations: [...] }`, then `ctx.shutdown()`.
- Prompt = trimmed OM observer prompt: "extract atomic events from THIS chunk; one line each;
  no markdown; prefer inline conversation timestamps." Drop relevance/sourceEntryIds language.

### A6. Compaction (`hooks/compaction-trigger.ts`, `hooks/compaction-hook.ts`)
- **Trigger** (`turn_end`): if context pressure `>= compactAtContextTokens` and not already
  compacting → `ctx.compact()` (fire-and-forget). `ctx.compact()` synchronously disconnects +
  aborts the agent loop up front, so firing it from `turn_end` is race-free; the
  `session_before_compact` hook waits for in-flight observers so the block reflects settled
  state. We fire on `turn_end` (not `agent_end`) so compaction pauses the chat *between* turns.
- **Auto-resume after a mid-run compaction** (`resumeAfterMidRunCompaction`, default true):
  a manual/threshold compaction always leaves the session idle (only pi's *internal overflow*
  path auto-retries). To make a mid-run compaction transparent, in `onComplete` we resume the
  agent ourselves via `ctx.sendMessage({ customType: "om.resume", display:false }, { triggerTurn:true })`
  — a hidden custom message pi surfaces to the model as a user turn (no agent-*invisible* resume
  exists through the public API; `convertToLlm` rewrites custom→user). The resume fires **only**
  when the turn had pending tool work. A `turn_end` that is also the run's terminal turn
  (`toolResults` empty) is left to stop, exactly as if no compaction happened. The mid-run
  decision is captured from the `turn_end` event *before* compaction aborts/reloads.
- **Hook** (`session_before_compact`), deterministic + model-free:
  1. `preparation.firstKeptEntryId` gives pi's proposed kept tail. **Snap** it to the nearest
     **observation chunk boundary** (a covered `coversUpToId` source-entry id) such that the
     verbatim tail ≈ `tailTokens`. The actual tail may be slightly larger/smaller to align.
  2. `buildCompactionProjection(branch, snappedFirstKeptId)` → active observations whose
     `coversUpToId` ≤ cutoff. Observations whose source lies in the kept tail are **excluded**
     (already verbatim) — this falls out of the projection boundary automatically.
  3. `renderSummary(map, observations)`: Phase A renders only the observations section
     (chronological, verbatim, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS  content`). The map section is a no-op
     placeholder until Phase B.
  4. return `{ compaction: { summary, firstKeptEntryId: snapped, tokensBefore, details } }`.
  - Guard against re-entrant hooks (OM's `compactHookInFlight`).

### A7. TUI (`ui/status-controller.ts`) — from the start (L1)
- Footer: `ctx.ui.setStatus("om", "om")` once at load; never cleared mid-session.
- Per-worker widgets keyed `<type>-<runId>` so parallel observers **stack**:
  - working: animate `◐◓◑◒` via periodic `setWidget` (interval cleared on finish/shutdown);
  - success: `✓ [observer] +N`, hold 5s, then `setWidget(key, undefined)`;
  - error: `✗ [observer]`, hold 5s, clear.
- Toasts via `ctx.ui.notify`: observer start (chunk tokens), finish (chunk tokens + N obs),
  error (+message). All gated on `ctx.hasUI`.

### A8. Commands (debug + control)
- `/om`, `/om on`, `/om off`: the on/off gate (A2a).
- `/om:status`: in-flight workers, observation count, next-observer token progress, live
  context usage vs `compactAtContextTokens`, last worker error. Reports "om is off" when gated off.
- `/om:compact`: force `ctx.compact()` now (ignores threshold). No-op when gated off.

### A9. Phase A acceptance
- Long scratch session: observers fire every ~`chunkTokens`, widgets stack, toasts log,
  observations appended to ledger; `/om:status` accurate.
- Compaction at threshold renders the observation block; cutoff lands on a chunk boundary; the
  verbatim tail is not double-represented.
- **`/tree` rollback**: navigate back past observation commits → folded buffer shrinks
  correctly (watermark folding); continue on a new branch → re-observation works. This is the
  primary Phase A test surface (design: short-term is `/tree`-testable).

---

## Phase B — long-term tier (consolidator + `.memory/`)

Goal: bound the buffer and gain durable, navigable, cross-session topic files.

### B1. `.memory/` substrate (`src/memory/paths.ts`)
- `<project>/.memory/` with `INDEX.md`, `<topic>.md`, `.runs/<runId>.json`.
- **Atomic writes**: temp file + `rename` over target so the master never reads a half-written
  file. (Consolidator edits files directly in the subprocess; same atomic helper there.)
- Filesystem **is** the recall interface — master uses normal `ls`/`read`/`grep`; no `recall`
  tool. Files are **not** rolled back by `/tree` (design: long-term tracks the repo).

### B2. Consolidator trigger (`hooks/consolidator-trigger.ts`)
- Clock: folded **active** observation pool tokens `>= consolidateAtPoolTokens` (200% of
  `poolTargetTokens`).
- **Strictly one consolidator at a time** (`consolidatorInFlight` flag — design risk 4).
- Promote **oldest-first**: select the overflow above `poolTargetTokens` (the oldest
  observations), serialize them + the current `.memory/` INDEX into the consolidator prompt.
- Spawn consolidator subprocess (`OM_WORKER=consolidator`); it edits `.memory/*.md` directly.
  It produces **no result file** — the file edits are the output, and the run ends by natural
  exit of `pi -p`.
- On clean exit (code 0): **tombstone the whole handed batch**, intersected with what is still
  active: `pi.appendEntry("om.observations.dropped", { observationTimestamps, coversUpToId })`.
  - **Critical (design risk 4):** the tombstone set = `handedBatch ∩ stillActive`. The handed
    batch is the enforcement mechanism — an observation an observer committed *during* the run
    is not in it, so it can never be tombstoned. The consolidator does **not** report back: it
    must consolidate everything it was given (filing or discarding noise are both valid), so we
    trust it on clean exit. This guarantees the buffer always drains (a report-subset model
    would strand un-filed/junk observations in the buffer forever, breaking the bounded-buffer
    invariant). A flaked-out partial run is recoverable from the worker's global session
    recording and is the critic tier's job to catch (decision 2).

### B3. Consolidator agent (`agent/consolidator/`) (L4)
- `before_agent_start`: replace system prompt with the topic-routing prompt.
- `--no-builtin-tools` ⇒ the extension must **register its own** `read`/`write`/`edit`/`ls`/`grep`
  **scoped to `.memory/`** (design risk 6). No terminal tool: the file edits are the output and
  the headless run ends by natural exit once the model emits its closing confirmation.
- Prompt: create/split/merge topic files; write clean current-state prose; remove superseded
  facts (no tombstone cruft); maintain front-matter (`id, title, summary, updated`). Routing
  aggressiveness is a tunable prompt knob (start conservative: prefer fewer, larger topics).
- Works from **observation text only** in v1 (decision 8 — no drill-to-source).

### B4. Injection map (`src/memory/index-render.ts`, extend `ledger/render.ts`)
- Compaction block section 1 = **memory map**: deterministically render `INDEX` from each
  topic file's front-matter (`path · summary · updated`) + a thin orientation header.
- Regenerated **each compaction**, never edited incrementally (design: throwaway projection,
  cannot decay).
- INDEX.md on disk is (re)rendered by the orchestrator after each consolidation so live
  `ls`/`grep` truth leads the pushed map (design risk 3 — accepted).

### B5b. Project journey (`JOURNEY.md`) — running descriptive history [implemented]

A third long-term artifact alongside the topic files and INDEX: a single, whole-project,
free-form prose narrative of **how the project/work got to where it is**. Purpose is
**orientation only** — give a freshly-compacted agent the rough arc so it stays on track —
not detailed recall (the topic files hold detail).

- **File:** `.memory/JOURNEY.md`. Consolidator-authored plain markdown, **no front-matter**.
  A special file like INDEX.md: **excluded** from `listTopics`/the memory map, never a topic.
- **Tier rules:** same as topic files — file-backed, shared across sessions, does **not** roll
  back under `/tree`.
- **Pushed, not pull-only:** rendered **verbatim from disk** into the compaction block as a
  new first section (`## Journey`), before the memory map and observations. So post-compaction
  the agent sees `journey` (settled past) → `map` (current topics) → `observations` (recent) →
  verbatim tail. Model-free at compaction (stays a throwaway render of a durable file).
- **Writer & cadence:** the **consolidator**, once per consolidation run. The current journey
  text is sent through its stdin prompt (like the INDEX); it rewrites the file with its scoped
  `write` tool. It narrates the arc of the **promoted (aging-out) batch**, so the journey
  trails the live buffer by ~`poolTargetTokens` — a clean, non-overlapping chronology.
- **Append-mostly + compress-tail (the buffer insight, one tier up):** each run appends one
  short dated segment and leaves recent segments intact; only when the file exceeds
  `journeyTargetTokens` does it **compress the oldest segments** into a tighter lead summary.
  Recent history stays detailed; the distant past decays gracefully. Bounds the pushed section.
- **Anti-steering (load-bearing prompt constraint):** strictly past-tense descriptive. **No**
  recommendations, next steps, TODOs, plans, advice, predictions, or evaluative judgement —
  enforced entirely in the consolidator system prompt. The block header also tells the reader
  it is orientation, not instruction.

> **Deliberate exception to Core Stance 5.** The journey is the *one* intentionally
> **cumulative** artifact — no actor ever sees the whole history, so the consolidator can only
> maintain it incrementally (the `MEMORY.md` decay mode the rest of the design avoids). Accepted
> because it is **low-stakes orientation, not recall**: decay is confined to the compressed

### B5. Phase B acceptance
- Buffer stays bounded near `poolTargetTokens`; consolidation drains overflow into topic files.
- Topic files are clean current-state prose; rewrites are atomic; master can `grep` them.
- Cross-session: a second session in the same project reads the same `.memory/` files.
- `/tree` past a consolidation re-activates promoted observations in the buffer while files do
  **not** roll back (design risk 1 — accepted; consolidator dedupes on next rewrite).

## Config (`src/config.ts`)

Namespace `observational-memory` under `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and project
`.pi/settings.json` (project overrides global). Defaults:

```jsonc
{
  "chunkTokens": 5000,
  "chunkOverlapTokens": 0,
  "poolTargetTokens": 10000,            // Phase B
  "consolidateAtPoolTokens": 20000,     // Phase B (200% of target)
  "compactAtContextTokens": 100000,     // tune per model
  "tailTokens": 20000,                  // verbatim tail; snaps to chunk boundary
  "journeyTargetTokens": 1000,          // Phase B — pushed JOURNEY.md size; compress old tail past this
  "observerConcurrency": 4,
  "models": {
    "observer":     { "provider": "anthropic", "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "thinking": "low" },
    "consolidator": { "provider": "anthropic", "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6", "thinking": "medium" }
  },
  "passive": false,
  "debugLog": false
}
```

`PI_OM_PASSIVE` env may force `passive` (disables all triggers) for clean `/tree` testing.

## Cross-cutting correctness (design risks → handling)

| Risk | Handling in v1 |
|---|---|
| R1 cross-tier double-rep on `/tree` | Accepted. Consolidator in-place dedupe keeps files sane; documented. |
| R2 just-promoted blind spot | INDEX summary quality is load-bearing; conservative routing + good front-matter. |
| R3 INDEX staleness | Master reads live FS; orchestrator re-renders INDEX.md post-consolidation. |
| R4 observer/consolidator concurrency | One consolidator at a time; tombstone the handed batch ∩ still-active (no report-back) — a during-run observation isn't in the batch, so never tombstoned. Enforced in `consolidator-trigger.ts`. |
| R5 compaction stalls on slow worker | Wait only for in-flight **observers** (not consolidators). **Fast path:** skip the wait entirely when no in-flight observer can affect the block (`canSkipObserverWait`) — each in-flight observer's chunk ends after the cutoff (excluded from the projection) **and** the snapped tail is already ≤ `tailTokens` (snap is provably stable). In the steady state observers cover only tail chunks, so compaction is instant; it only blocks for a genuinely pre-cutoff slow observer (out-of-order completion). |
| R6 `--no-builtin-tools` + consolidator | Consolidator extension registers its own `.memory/`-scoped read/write/edit. |
| R7 timestamp-id reliability | Resolved by L5: orchestrator assigns ids; observer emits minute-resolution only. |

## Open tuning items (defaults set; revisit during use)

- `compactAtContextTokens`, `tailTokens` — tune per target model (defaults above).
- `chunkOverlapTokens` — default 0; raise if boundary-spanning events are lost.
- Consolidator topic-routing aggressiveness — start conservative (fewer, larger topics).
- Observer/consolidator model split — currently strong everywhere (L6); try cheap/fast
  observers once quality is validated.

## Build sequence (checklist)

**Phase A**
1. Scaffold package + tsconfig + vitest.
2. Vendor & trim ledger/tokens/ids/serialize/debug-log; port + prune tests.
3. Orchestrator skeleton + config + runtime + TUI status controller (footer).
3a. Per-session on/off gate (default OFF): `om.enabled` state, `/om` `/om on` `/om off`,
    outermost `if (!enabled) return;` guard in every handler.
4. `spawn/launch.ts` + `spawn/runs.ts` (IPC) + smoke test.
5. Worker agent extension (observer mode) + `record_observations` terminal tool.
6. Observer trigger (parallel, fixed-boundary chunks) + commit-to-ledger + widgets/toasts.
7. Compaction trigger + hook (cutoff-on-boundary render) .
8. `/om:status`, `/om:compact`.
9. Acceptance: long session, parallel observers, compaction, `/tree` rollback.

**Phase B** — implemented
10. ✅ `.memory/` paths + atomic write + INDEX render (`src/memory/{paths,index-render}.ts`).
11. ✅ Consolidator agent: scoped `read/write/edit/ls/grep`, no terminal tool (natural exit)
    (`agent/consolidator/{prompt,tools}.ts`).
12. ✅ Consolidator trigger: pool clock, one-at-a-time, oldest-first, tombstone the
    provided∩still-active batch on clean exit (no report-back); drop `coversUpToId` = tip's
    last source entry (`src/hooks/consolidator-trigger.ts`).
13. ✅ Memory-map section in the injection block (live from disk at compaction) +
    post-consolidation INDEX.md re-render. `/om:consolidate` + extended `/om:status`.
14. Acceptance (manual): bounded buffer, clean topic files, cross-session read, `/tree` semantics.

Resolved Phase-B decisions: the consolidator must consolidate everything it is handed
(filing or discarding noise are both valid), so it does **not** report back — the orchestrator
tombstones the whole handed batch (∩ still-active) on clean exit. Race-safety comes from the
handed batch, not a report: a during-run observation is not in it, so it is never tombstoned.
This also guarantees the buffer drains (a report-subset model would strand un-filed/junk
observations forever). The orchestrator owns INDEX.md (consolidator never writes it);
consolidator authors full
front-matter using an injected current-time; runs in the background concurrent with observers
(compaction never waits for it).

## Explicitly out of v1 (per design)

Critic/verification tier · git-versioned `.memory` · conscious "jot" write path / scratchpad
· drill-to-source consolidation · `.memory/.runs` GC · per-position `/tree` correctness for
long-term memory · multi-agent `.memory` sharing/merge.

## Addendum — per-session memory scoping (post-v1)

Long-term memory is now scoped per session: everything that used to live flat under
`<project>/.memory/` (`INDEX.md`, `<topic>.md`, `JOURNEY.md`, and `.runs/`) now lives under
`<project>/.memory/<sessionId>/`. The key is the **immutable session-header id**
(`sessionManager.getSessionId()`), which survives `/name`, `/resume`, and `/tree` — never the
session filename UUID (can diverge) or display name (mutated by `/name`).

- **Why:** two sessions in the same directory were sharing (and clobbering) one consolidator
  output. Scoping by session id isolates them.
- **Fork/clone seeding:** the short-term ledger already travels with a fork, so the long-term
  tier is seeded to match. `ensureSessionMemory` (src/memory/session.ts) copies the parent's
  memory root in **once, on first touch** (parent discovered via the durable `parentSession`
  header lineage), excluding transient `.runs/`. Idempotent: an existing root is never
  re-seeded, so `/resume` and `/tree` never disturb it. No parent ⇒ lazy create on first write.
- **Mechanics:** `sessionMemoryRoot(cwd, sessionId)` is the chokepoint; all path helpers
  (`indexPath`/`journeyPath`/`readJourney`/`listTopics`/`resolveWithinMemory`, `run*Path`) take
  the resolved **root**. The orchestrator stores it on `runtime.memoryRoot` (set whenever the
  gate is enabled) and passes the worker its session dir via `OM_MEMORY_DIR`. The worker /
  agent side is unchanged — it only ever receives explicit paths.
- **Memory-map paths** advertised to the master are rendered relative to the project cwd
  (`.memory/<sessionId>/<topic>.md`) so its `read`/`grep` resolve to the right session dir.
- **Not migrated:** pre-existing flat `.memory/*` content is left in place and ignored (clean
  break). `/tree` correctness for the long-term tier is still out of scope (now per-session).
